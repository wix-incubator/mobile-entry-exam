# Wix Mobile Entry Level Exam

In this exam, you will extend and add new features to a back-office order management system. The task's main purpose is to test your ability to learn new topics and deliver high quality digital products. It combines building UI components and a touch of server development as well.
While no previous background is required to complete this task or to apply to this position, we do recommend getting to a basic level on the following subjects:
- Git
- Javascript / TypeScript
- HTML & CSS
- React
- Node.js

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account
2. Go [here](https://github.com/new/import) and import this repository into your account. Make sure to select the **private** option
3. [Clone](https://github.com/wix-incubator/mobile-students-exam) your new repository to your computer
4. Make sure you have *Node.js* 10 or higher and *npm* 6 or higher installed (Too high versions of Node may be incompatible, recommended version to use is Node v14) 
5. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install` from the project's directory (using a terminal)
6. Run the project by running `npm start`

You should now have the development version running on your computer and accessible via http://localhost:3000

## Before you start

The current code base is far from perfect. While you complete the following tasks, try to improve the existing code. The system should be **scalable**, and should support different screens and devices.

### Part A - List content:

1. We added a button for changing the delivery status, but it doesn’t seem to do anything. Please fix it.

1. Our call center asked us for more data on each order. Find a UX solution and implement it. They want to see the following when clicking on an item:
	1. Name and quantity of the ordered items
	1. Images of the items (or an image of the most expensive item)
	1. The exact time of the order

### Part B - Search and filters:

1. We are showing the last 20 orders. The rumor in the call centers says there are a lot more. Please fix this, and **remember that we’re spreading worldwide, and we will have many more orders soon. Much much more.**

2. The simple search we provide isn’t enough. We need to add an ability to search for item names as well.

3. **[BONUS]** - Add an ability to filter orders by fulfillment and payment status.

### Part C - Your personal touch:

Think of a small addition to this project and make it happen. It should involve adding something to the UI, or server (or both!). A good rule of thumb for the effort here is that it should not exceed the time that it took you to perform Part B.
Please describe the feature you've added on your email back to us

Note: this step is also mandatory.

### Part D - Bonus mission

One of the things that really important to our users is to know the number of orders that still didn't deliver (orders with a status of not deliver)
Think of a nice way to display, and keep it updated 

## General notes

* Test your work well. Think of edge cases. Think of how users will use it, and make sure your work is of high quality
* Stick to the best practices of the libraries used as much as possible
* This task involves both the client and server code. Regardless of bonuses and part 3, in the end, you should have touched both areas. If you haven't - you probably are not covering all our requirements.
* If you have any questions regarding the task itself or its environment, feel free to ask in the exam's e-mail. For general coding / technology questions, please consult stack overflow, forums and other sources of your choice.

## Submitting

1. add username: `wix-home-exam`, email: `wix-home-exam@wix.com` as collaborators to your imported repo.

2. send the repo's URL back to the email you got from us. Describe your extra touch (part 3), and any general notes you may have. Can be anything from challenges to something you feel was not done perfectly, to something you're especially proud of.
